# 1D_active_folding_unfolding
1D toy model of active folding and unfolding

# Instructions
To run the simulation:
1. Set sheet parameters in parameters.m
2. Load parameters.m
3. runSimulation(params). runSimulation returns the simulation outcome (final folding state of the lattice) and time (number of steps to reach a folded or flat state). sheet_states stores the lattice folding state at each time step.
